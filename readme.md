# PHP-JSON ENDPOINT EXAMPLE

This example uses jQuery to make an AJAX request to a PHP API endpoint and retrieve a PHP array of objects encoded as JSON, then uses jQuery to loop over the array and gather data from each object and form table rows with each corresponding html element as needed. It uses Bootstrap to style the table.
